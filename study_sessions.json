        "flashcards": "Q: What are the three types of symbiotic relationships?\nA: Commensalism (1 benefits, 0 harmed), Mutualism (2 benefit), Parasitism (1 benefits, 1 harmed).\n---\nQ: What is the main difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?\nA: Prokaryotes have no nucleus; eukaryotes have a nucleus and organelles.\n---\nQ: What is the powerhouse of the cell?\nA: Mitochondria.\n---\nQ: What is the process of photosynthesis represented by the equation?\nA: CO2 + H2O + light \u2192 O2 + glucose.\n---\nQ: What are homologous structures and how do they provide evidence for evolution?\nA: Homologous structures are anatomical features that are similar in different species due to shared ancestry, providing evidence of evolutionary relationships.\n---\nQ: In DNA, which base pairs with adenine?\nA: Thymine.\n---\nQ: What are the two types of succession and their definitions?\nA: Primary succession (new life where none existed) and Secondary succession (regrowth after disturbance).\n---\nQ: Name two organelles found in plant cells but not in animal cells.\nA: Chloroplasts and cell wall.\n---\nQ: What is the genotype?\nA: The genetic makeup of an organism.\n---\nQ: Describe the steps of protein synthesis.\nA: Transcription (DNA \u2192 mRNA) and Translation (mRNA \u2192 protein).",
        "quiz_data": "Q1: Which symbiotic relationship benefits both organisms?  \nA) Parasitism  \nB) Commensalism  \nC) Mutualism  \nD) Predation  \nCorrect: C  \nExplanation: Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit from the interaction.\n\n---\n\nQ2: What is the powerhouse of the cell?  \nA) Ribosome  \nB) Mitochondria  \nC) Golgi body  \nD) Nucleus  \nCorrect: B  \nExplanation: The mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell because they produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell.\n\n---\n\nQ3: In DNA, adenine pairs with:  \nA) Guanine  \nB) Thymine  \nC) Cytosine  \nD) Uracil  \nCorrect: B  \nExplanation: In DNA, adenine pairs with thymine, following the base pairing rules of nucleic acids.\n\n---\n\nQ4: Which type of succession occurs after a volcanic eruption forms new land?  \nA) Primary  \nB) Secondary  \nC) Gradualism  \nD) Punctuated equilibrium  \nCorrect: A  \nExplanation: Primary succession occurs in an area where no soil exists, such as after a volcanic eruption, allowing new life to establish.\n\n---\n\nQ5: Which biome has permafrost?  \nA) Desert  \nB) Tundra  \nC) Rainforest  \nD) Taiga  \nCorrect: B  \nExplanation: The tundra biome is characterized by permafrost, a permanently frozen layer of soil beneath the surface.",
